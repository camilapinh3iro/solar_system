        "description": "Orbital Eccentricity is a measure that represents the departure of an orbit from the circular shape. It is usually represented by values ​​between 0 and 1, but values ​​greater than 1 are observed in some orbits of comets or space probes."

        "name": "Density",
        "description": "The Density of a body is defined as the quotient between the mass and the volume of that body. In this way, it can be said that density measures the degree of concentration of mass in a given volume."

        "name": "Mean Radius",
        "description": "The Mean Radius of an orbit is half the distance between aphelion and perihelion. Knowing this, Kepler's third law allows us to infer that the farther (on average) a planet is from the Sun, the greater its period of translation, that is, the greater the time it takes to complete one revolution."

        "name": "Escape",
        "description": "The velocity with which a body must be launched from the surface of a planet so that it goes to infinity, never returning, is called Escape Velocity. The escape velocity is obtained from the condition that at infinity the mechanical energy of the launched body is zero."
